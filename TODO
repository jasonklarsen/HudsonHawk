Bugs:

Items yet to do:
- Implement retry mechanism for failed status changes
- Provide a visual indicator of the change description actions (so we can see when the flicker state *does* get set....)
- Show svn user name that checked-in in exploded popup
- Show svn user name from upstream builds in downstream failure
- Add a revert to original status button
- Sorting builds by most recent build at the top (on first load)
- Better error handling for Hudson going down (or a failed AJAX call)
- Provide a comment on build detail screen that is persisted like status
- Provide special notification when Hudson is unavailable  (Do we empty the screen and display a message?  Do we grey out previous status?)
- Investigate more browser combinations (esp. IEs)
- Provide better error messages when missing Settings data is needed
- Provide multiple server/views to watch
- Provide integration into Nagios
- Use jQuery ThemeBuilder stuff to build a better theme for dialog box

To consider:
- Visible indicator for number of consecutive broken builds?
- Visible indicator for time broken? Time broken since first failure?
- Visible indicator for time left building?
- Consider doubling size when a build breaks after someone marks on as Being Fixed
- Consider script to strip out JS and run unit tests on HudsonHawk
- Better hiding/encryption of passwords to Hudson.  Maybe a "ask when needed" popup instead.
- Provide special notification when all is well (Text?  Big thumbs up?)
- Showing in progress green builds
- Shrinking "Build: Fixed" jobs
- Consider "scrolling" solution if number of builds spans the whole screen
- Put a meta refresh on the page for every hour or so (to hide any memory leaks with jQueryUI)
- Add a re-build button (or should they be required to look at the build?) 

DONE
- Save view in a cookie to bypass popup
- Use HTML5 storage to save data (if supported).  Allows Chrome usage as file:// to persist settings.
- Specify Hudson server in a popup
- Save Hudson server to cookie to bypass popup
- Auto refresh status periodically
- Provide better feedback during settings setup that we are still getting data for views (maybe grey background screen?)
- Add pulsating for in-progress builds
- Add Click on failed build to see detail
- On failed build detail screen, can click button to mark as Flicker
- Builds marked as Flicker are remembered in Hudson jobs detail
- On failed build detail screen, can click button to mark as Being Fixed (and remembered like Flickers)
- Make new failed builds created an exploded detail view filling the screen
- Add Settings button to popup current settings for editing
- Queue description changes
- Pulsate should not go to 0% opacity (leave 10% or so) -- Also try not to utilise 100% of a CPU when building.
- In progress notification seems to take an extra refresh cycle to register.  TestCase: Simply open screen when a known build is in progress.  Highlights only after a refresh.
- Auto-resize for smaller width screens (esp. side panel usage or long project names)

Features 
- Able to choose a Hudson view for running against.  So, only need to maintain group information in one place, Hudson.
- Automatically refreshes status, alerting for newly broken builds and broken builds that are now in progress with a new run.
- Detailed information popup (when clicking on a failed build) that:
  - Allows you to view the build in Hudson
  - Change the status to customs statuses: Fixed and Flicker  (which is persisted in Hudson for other concurrent Hudson Hawks to use)
- Configuration settings persisted in local storage (cookies or HTML5 storage)
- Mini mode can be specified by adding the http parameter 'mini'.  This shrinks the side suitable for very small widths (like Firefox side bar usage)
