Items yet to do:
- Provide reset button to remove view/server from cookie
- Add pulsating for in-progress builds
- Make new failed builds created an exploded detail view filling the screen
- Add Click on failed build to see detail
- On failed build detail screen, can click button to mark as Flicker
- Builds marked as Flicker are remembered in Hudson jobs detail
- On failed build detail screen, can click button to mark as Being Fixed (and remembered like Flickers)
- Provide a comment on build detail screen that is persisted like status
- Provide special notification when Hudson is unavailable  (Do we empty the screen and display a message?  Do we grey out previous status?)
- Provide special notification when all is well (Text?  Big thumbs up?)
- Provide better feedback during settings setup that we are still getting data for views (maybe grey background screen?)

To consider:
- Visible indicator for number of consecutive broken builds?
- Visible indicator for time broken? Time broken since first failure?
- Visible indicator for time left building?
- Sorting builds by most recent build at the top

DONE
- Save view in a cookie to bypass popup
- Use HTML5 storage to save data (if supported).  Allows Chrome usage as file:// to persist settings.
- Specify Hudson server in a popup
- Save Hudson server to cookie to bypass popup
- Auto refresh status periodically
